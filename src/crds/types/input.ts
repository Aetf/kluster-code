             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the

             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may

             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *

             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs

             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may

             * if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.
             *
             * For example, take the following matches configuration:
             *
             * ```
             * matches:
             * - method:
             *     service: foo.bar
             *   headers:
             *     values:

             * - method:
             *     service: foo.bar.v2
             * ```
             *
             * For a request to match against this rule, it MUST satisfy
             * EITHER of the two conditions:
             *
             * - service of foo.bar AND contains the header `version: 2`
             * - service of foo.bar.v2
             *
             * See the documentation for GRPCRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
             * match conditions to be ANDed together.
             *
             * If no matches are specified, the implementation MUST match every gRPC request.
             *
             * Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from GRPCRoutes
             * MUST prioritize rules based on the following criteria, continuing on
             * ties. Merging MUST not be done between GRPCRoutes and HTTPRoutes.
             * Precedence MUST be given to the rule with the largest number of:
             *
             * * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
             * * Characters in a matching hostname.
             * * Characters in a matching service.
             * * Characters in a matching method.
             * * Header matches.
             *
             * If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
             * determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:
             *
             * * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
             * * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
             *   "{namespace}/{name}".
             *
             * If ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence,
             * matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting
             * the above criteria.

             * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
             * apply in that case).
             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
             * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their
             * targeted conformance profile:
             *
             * HTTP Profile
             *
             * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
             * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
             *
             * TLS Profile

             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
             *
             * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
             *    Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
             *    "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
             *    with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
             *
             * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
             * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
             * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
             *
             * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
             * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
             * Listener to be distinct.
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
             * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
             * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
             * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
             * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
             * least one Listener must be present.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
             * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
             * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
             *
             * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
             *    Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
             *    "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
             *    with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
             *
             * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
             * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
             * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
             *
             * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
             * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
             * Listener to be distinct.
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
             * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
             * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
             * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
             * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
             * least one Listener must be present.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
             * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
             * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

             *

             *

             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *

             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs

             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may

             * Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
             * they are specified.
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
             * any combination or order of filters that can not be supported. If implementations
             * choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
             * that behavior.
             *
             * To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
             * consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
             * in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
             * a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
             * "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.
             *
             * Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:
             *
             * - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
             * - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
             * - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
             *   implementations.
             *
             * Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
             * indicated in the filter.
             *
             * All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
             * URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
             * implementation can not support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
             * document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
             * filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
             * `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify

             * * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by

             *   implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
             *   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
             *   is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to

             * Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
             * extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
             *
             * If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
             * MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
             * that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
             * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their
             * targeted conformance profile:
             *
             * HTTP Profile
             *
             * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
             * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
             *
             * TLS Profile

             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
             *
             * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
             *    Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
             *    "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
             *    with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
             *
             * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
             * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
             * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
             *
             * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
             * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
             * Listener to be distinct.
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
             * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
             * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
             * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
             * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
             * least one Listener must be present.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
             * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
             * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
             *
             * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
             *    Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
             *    "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
             *    with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
             *
             * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
             * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
             * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
             *
             * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
             * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
             * Listener to be distinct.
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
             * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
             * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
             * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
             * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
             * least one Listener must be present.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
             * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
             * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

             * both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
             *

             * `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.

             * match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The

             * `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
             *
             * In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.

             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be

             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the

             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may

             *
             * Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.
             *
             * If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
             * determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:
             *
             * * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
             * * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
             *   "{namespace}/{name}".
             *
             * If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
             * to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above

         * core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
         * When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
         * the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
         * provisioner.
         * This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
         * if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
         * compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
         * both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
         * value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
         * When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
         * dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
         * There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
         * * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
         *   allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
         * * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
         *   preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
         *   specified.
         * * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
         *   in any namespaces.
         * (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
         * (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
